# Project Proposal

As previously mentioned, this interface address a number of critical disciplinary problems. To begin with, this interface will publicly track the projects being done and articles being published. As such, the interface will allow for both the public and professionals to hold researchers accountable to a) publish their research and b) share it with both the public and their colleagues in a timely manner. The interface therefore provides the opportunity for ground-breaking inter- and intra-disciplinary collaboration. Students and professionals alike will work towards something bigger than each individual person or discipline, and work beyond the artificial disciplinary boundaries (i.e., distinctions of “archaeologist”, “historian”, “ethnographer”) which exist between all those who study human culture and behaviour. Moreover, the interface will make the fruits of that collaborative labour accessible to the public, because history is for all mankind. 

Within the archaeological and heritage disciplines specifically, we are experiencing a mounting crisis known as “the storage crisis”, for obvious reasons, and which includes a significant backlog of analyses. At the heart of both these problems are a) there is not enough room to store all of these artefacts for the next 100 generations (try as we might), and b) there are often significantly more artefacts on a given project than there are trained professionals to analyze them. This interface project addresses both of these crises. We may not be able to physically store and preserve every single artefact from every single site for multiple generations to come, but we can conduct as many analyses on them as possible, and take 3D scans of them so that future generations can at least reproduce them if necessary, while physically preserving a few artifacts for future generations to test new and better methods on. Moreover, the interface addresses the analysis backlog twofold. The promotion of, participation in, and funding for this project will provide incentive for more students and professionals to contribute their time. Meanwhile, a collection of sherds sitting in the basement at the University of Toronto because our lab teams are too preoccupied with a groundbreaking discovery, will no longer mean that work stops. Typological artifact analyses and coding can be outsourced, for example, to a university in Arizona with less work on their plates, thanks to the interface’s sophisticated imaging technology. So long as the images are captured of the collections as they are each given an ID, cleaned, and put into storage, the burden of work can be shared just as much as the information is.

Next, an obvious obstacle to the preservation of material culture and physical documents and recordings is their nature to decay over time. Additionally, preservation of certain material culture can be emotionally and spiritually injurious to some cultures (e.g., the Hopi and Zuni), despite our good intentions. Moreover, because these are the very objects form which national pride and identity are so frequently amassed, they have historically been directly targeted as prisoners and casualties of various wars and conflicts. A famous example of this would be the collection of the museum collections of conquered nations by the Nazis. More recently and distressingly, ISIS/ISIL has targeted and pillaged countless sites and warehouses in the middle east to profit off of black market sales of material culture while damaging heritage. Exceeding this, ISIS/ISIL has intentionally destroyed dozens of sites, and even murdered a Syrian archaeologist for defending their location. The impermanence of material culture (artefacts, features, sites, etc.) is what makes them vulnerable and such easy targets. The sophisticated image capturing and reproduction information that this interface will utilize negates the crisis of each of these problems from occurring ever again. It cannot, however, keep physical culture from decaying. So long as the interface data survives, there will be no need to fight the passage of time, to offend or even harm the very people we study, nor die to prevent the loss heritage.

Finally, research is often restrained by issues of geography and geopolitics. To being with, typical research necessitates the journey to the (often distant) region of interest in order, for example, to view a particular artifact or document which can’t leave its national border, or to view a site or feature so monumental and/or fragile that it cannot be moved. Next, when a region falls under conflict, whether it be internal or external, research in the region tends to experience a hiatus until resolved. Additionally, geopolitics tend to create even more obstacles to research. For example, a Jewish archaeologist is unable to visit Palestine to practice or even witness a single artefact. Similarly, national pride and geopolitical conflicts often arise over conflicts of heritage ownership. The proposed interface will bridge geographical distance, and erase geopolitical obstacles. The ability of the interface to examine documents, objects and features in high resolution, 3D, and even VR imaging, as well as the ability to physically print a 3D model copy, means that geographical distance and national borders should never again be an obstacle to the progress of research. Moreover, the interface begins to significantly tackle the issue of heritage ownership. While it would not rectify, for example, the Dead Sea Scroll Conflict, it would allow for institutions such as the British Museum to relinquish ownership of their many controversial items, e.g. the Parthenon marbles, without losing the ability to study and enjoy them.
