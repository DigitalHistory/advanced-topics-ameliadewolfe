# Kenya, A Case Study of Interaction Spheres: the Okiek, Kipsigis, and Maasai at the Time of Colonial Contact

<p>The Okiek, Kipsigis, and Maasai are groups of hunter gatherers and agro-pastoralists who intersect as historical neighbours within the Narok district of Kenya, around the Mau escarpment (Kratz, 5)[1](#one). Although neighbours historically, they have become __increasingly concentrated__ around Mau since the time of British settlement (Kratz 5, 57)[^2]. Land was first designated for British settlement at the beginning of the 20th century (1906) at Kericho (Kratz, 77)[^3]. For the Okiek especially, this process has meant an increasing sedentism and a gradual shift in their subsistence economy, meanwhile, those such as the Kipsigis and Maasai are increasingly interacting with modern Kenyan government and moving further away from their traditional settlement regions, as their land is now being sold off or appropriated by the Kenyan government (Kratz 73-79)[^4]. While the Okiek groups discussed here were traditionally settled deep in the escarpment forest, they have moved to the outskirts of the escarpment slopes (Kratz 5)[^5]. The Maasai groups discussed here were traditionally located north of the escarpment but have since moved to the plains at the foot of the southern side of the escarpment (Kratz 66)[^6]. Similarly, the Kipsigis were traditionally settled on the western plains, west of the Amara river tributary, but have since crossed the Amara into the east, and settled in the same region as the Maasai at the southern foothills and plains of the Mau escarpment (Kratz, 68)[^7]. Meanwhile, European settlements around Mau gradually increased in a southeastern directionality (Kratz 77)[^8]. </p>
<p>This can be a confusing line of thought to follow or conceptualize from simply reading it. Particularly, this is hard to follow for those are unfamiliar with African geography and landscape features. Despite this, all of the above content is derived from the ethnographic life work published by Corinne Kratz, who never depicted this data on a map, or even discussed each dataset on the same page, even though it was central to one of her arguments. Kratz’s argument (among others) is that the focus of colonial and Kenyan government on the Kipsigis and the Maasai created a social buffer zone between the Okiek and colonial influence, which is why Okiek lifeways and social conventions have not been as radically or adversely altered like has been the case with other hunter-gatherers (Kratz 64-70, 312)[^9]. </p>
<p>What about the spatial component of this argument? If Kratz’s datasets were more detailed regarding colonialist movement and zones of extended interaction spheres over time, one would expect to find a physical buffer zone which correlates with her social one. What I propose then, is that mapping these movements and relationships spatially over time might in fact indicate that the Kipsigis and Maasai acted as a social buffer because there was some sort of physical buffer, a physical segregation where spheres of interaction did not overlap as intensely between Okiek and colonial/Kenyan governments, as they did with the Kipsigis and Maasai with the colonial/Kenyan governments. </p>
	<p>As such, I have visually (and much more plainly) deciphered and displayed the spatial and temporal arguments and data presented by Kratz in her ethnography in the following map. The map is a close up of the points of interest within the Narok district. We can track the relationship between the approximate changes in Okiek, Kipsigis, and Maasai settlement locations over time, and in relation to British settlement (Kratz, 65-80)[^10]. Because of the ambiguities in timelines and lack of historical records related to the Kipsigis, Okiek, and Maasai, I have simply divided the two time periods into the first and second half of the 20th century (Kratz, 304-305, 340)[^11]. Each represented group is represented by a marker with their own colour, with the shade progressing from light to dark over time. While this sort of a culture history/direct historical study would be best presented with some sort of timelapse GIS, the benefits of turning Kratz’s arguments into a spatial one become clear with the following map.</p>



Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

<p>Studying patterns of mobility and interaction spheres is something which archaeologists frequently attempt. This map presents new patterns and spatial/geographical relationships that Kratz herself may not have even considered, and that may have never been considered otherwise. What the map shows what Kratz’s words did not convey; that the groups are converging in the second half of the century on the southern side of the Mau escarpment, with groups moving the least-to-greatest distance over time from the Okiek, to the Kipsigis, to the Maasai. Kratz presents the same gradient of impact on lifeways from interaction with the colonial/Kenyan governments. Additionally, Kratz emphasizes the crossing of the Amara tributary by the Kipsigis, but not the crossing of the Mau escarpment by the Maasai.</p>
<p>Another reason that perhaps the Okiek hunter-gatherers had little impact from European settlement in Kenya is because of the simple fact that they lived in and exploited the Mau escarpment forest, meanwhile their agro-pastoralist neighbours lived on and exploited it’s plains. Perhaps the British settlers didn’t find it useful to venture further into the region - everyone was and continue to be around the escarpment meanwhile the Okiek were, and still are, within it. This especially makes sense within the context of a quote by the region’s first ethnographer, Roderic Blackburn, as he postulates the reason that no other groups inhabited the forest region was as follows: </p>

>“it is quite evident that pastoralists, unfamiliar with Okiek modes of adaptation and technology, could not survive in the forest. Even if they had attempted to do so it is likely that they would have been killed by Okiek for transgressing lineage rights over their territorial resources, just as Okiek lineages have feuded among themselves for this same reason” (Blackburn 147)[^12].

<p> This map not only represents the argument then, it becomes the argument, and shows the path of where to take the argument/study next as new spatial patterns emerge. It also becomes an insightful exercise in its very making, which highlights where data is ambiguous or lacking.</p>
<p>That being said. There are many problems converting this argument into a spatially and visually augmented one. As mentioned, the Okiek, Kipsigis and Maasai have little in the way of a historical record, so the dates and exact locations plotted here are rather ambiguous, and more approximate than anything (which is not particularly made clear by the visual display)(Kratz, 304-305, 340)[^13]. Next, the map’s data presentation ignores the historical seasonal mobility, and increasing sedentism of the Okiek, Kipsigis, and Maasai, and fails to delineate their territory as fluid spaces which span entire regions with blurry boundaries rather than being static, fixed points on a map (Kratz 74)[^14]. Additionally, the map’s limited dataset fails to address where else the British and contemporary Kenyans and their governments may have moved through the landscape aside from their settlements, or may have crossed paths with their groups, nor who or what else was going on around the Okiek, Kipsigis, and Maasai settlements at the times delineated (e.g. market economies being established, cities emerging, schools being built) (Kratz 7). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the map presentation removes all the complex social contexts of the data. For example, the cultural associations are much more complicated than simply, for example, Okiek vs Kipsigis groups and Okiek vs Kipsigis territory. Each group have their own very distinct tribes, located in more areas than just around the Mau (Kratz 62-63)[^15]. They are culturally fluid groups spread throughout Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, who speak multiple languages, appropriate various aspects of one-another’s cultural conventions and languages, and at times, marry into the communities of one another (Blackburn 140-142)[^16]. Although, they do, as Blackburn states, “clearly conceive of this socio-geographic category, as shown by the proper name” such as “ Kipchornwonek” i.e. an Okiek tribe (Blackburn 142)[^17].  The map’s presentation furthermore removes other social contexts such as ethnic/cultural identity and regional social hierarchy (Maasai on top, and Okiek on the bottom) of the various groups, which is quite messy. For example, the Okiek are  “a group of hunters and gatherers who called themselves Okiek and are so called by all Kalenjin-speaking peoples” (to which the Kipsigis belong but the Maasai do not) but are otherwise called “Dorobo”, a derogatory Maasai term which lumps the Okiek in with the rest of the region’s hunter-gatherers or “poor people” (which the Kipsigis are not)(Blackburn 139)[^18]. Moreover, the other groups see the Okiek as at the bottom of the social hierarchy, meanwhile the Okiek conceptualize themselves as equals to their neighbours. Unfortunately then, the map cannot convey the social intricacies of the interaction spheres depicted by the map. It loses all social context but adds new context, a spatial context. </p>
